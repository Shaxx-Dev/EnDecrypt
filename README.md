# EnDecrypt
EnDecrypt is a simple web-based application designed to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an easy-to-use interface for users to encode and decode their messages.

Features
Encryption: Allows users to input text and encrypt it using a specified shift value.
Decryption: Allows users to decrypt the encrypted text using the same shift value.
User Input Validation: Ensures that users provide valid text and shift values for the encryption and decryption processes.
Technologies Used
HTML: Used for structuring the web page and its content.
CSS: Used for styling the web page, making it visually appealing.
JavaScript: Used for implementing the core functionality of encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
Caesar Cipher Algorithm
The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, 'A' would be replaced by 'B', 'B' would become 'C', and so on.
