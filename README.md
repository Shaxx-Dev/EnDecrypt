# EnDecrypt

EnDecrypt is a simple web-based application designed to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an easy-to-use interface for users to encode and decode their messages.

Features:

1.Encryption: Allows users to input text and encrypt it using a specified shift value.
2.Decryption: Allows users to decrypt the encrypted text using the same shift value.
3.User Input Validation: Ensures that users provide valid text and shift values for the encryption and decryption     processes.
4.Technologies Used
5.HTML: Used for structuring the web page and its content.
6.CSS: Used for styling the web page, making it visually appealing.
7.JavaScript: Used for implementing the core functionality of encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.


Caesar Cipher Algorithm:

The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, 'A' would be replaced by 'B', 'B' would become 'C', and so on.
